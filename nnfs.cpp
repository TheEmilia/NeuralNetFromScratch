// Neuron Code
// Neurons are a function that returns the sum of a number of inputs, multiplied by their respective weights, and a bias
// Takes a vector of input values, a vector of weight values corresponding to those input values, and a bias
// Returns a single value of type double
// Every neuron in a layer takes in the same inputs, but has different weights and bias, and thus returns a different value
